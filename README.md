## Introduction ##

We present a study of the sensitivity of current gravitational-wave search pipelines to eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers using data from the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. The detection of BBH mergers with measurable orbital eccentricity would provide clear evidence for a dynamical formation channel for such systems. However, most existing searches are tuned for quasicircular mergers, due to challenges arising from increased waveform complexity and limited availability of efficient eccentric models.

Our study evaluates the performance of the matched-filter-based \texttt{PyCBC} and the unmodeled coherent WaveBurst (\texttt{cWB}) pipelines using injections of spinning eccentric BBH signals modeled with the multipolar, nonprecessing-spin waveform \texttt{SEOBNRv4EHM}. We find that \texttt{PyCBC} loses between 10â€“20% of sensitivity for sources with eccentricities above 0.2 at 10 Hz, highlighting the impact of template mismatch. In contrast, \texttt{cWB} exhibits a relative gain of ~10% in sensitivity for heavier systems (with chirp mass \mathcal{M} \geq 30M_\odot). However, it remains less sensitive than \texttt{PyCBC} for lighter binaries.
